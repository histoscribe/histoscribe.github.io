# Histoscribe
An ICS 496 Spring 2025 Capstone Project - Transcribing Historical Documents using Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This page will track the progress and milestones for the ICS 496 group project. In general, the goal of the project is to utilize Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models to accurately transcribe historical handwritten documentation. The timeline of our project will include determining which tools and approach will best achieve this goal.

## Week 1
For our initial meeting and consultation the project sponsor, we worked to solidify the scope of work that was to be accomplished. There were many questions that would have to be answered before we could fully determine the scope of work, and whether that work would be achievable within our timeline. Despite what would seem like an easy task, there were many questions that needed to be answered: 
* Are there legal implications for uploading archival documents onto open or subscription AI transcribing services?
* Would the Artificial Intelligence models be easier to train down to a specific author? Or would the models be better suited for covering the vernacular and styles of a given time period?
* What products are out there currently that can best achieve our goal?

At the end of our first week, we would have to answer many questions to hopefully narrow down the scope and feasibility of our project.
